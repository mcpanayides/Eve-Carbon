# Eve-Carbon


Eve Carbon is a powerful, all-in-one web application built with Python 3 and Django, designed to be a Swiss Army knife for EVE Online pilots and fleet commanders. From managing Fleet Ship Replacement Programs (SRP) and market orders, to hosting a built-in community forum, Eve Carbon brings essential tools together in one seamless platform.

The entire application is containerized using Docker, making it easy to set up, deploy, and scale across any environment. Just clone the repo, spin up the containers with docker-compose, and you're ready to launch your own EVE Online operations hub.
